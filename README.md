## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Fernando, a passionate developer with a focus on full-stack development. I work with technologies like Node.js, Express, Docker, TailwindCSS and databases.

ðŸŽ¨ Iâ€™m also specializing in web design, creating beautiful and responsive layouts using CSS and Tailwind CSS. I enjoy crafting clean and user-friendly designs that enhance the user experience.

ðŸ”§ I love exploring new technologies, continuously learning, and collaborating on exciting projects. Outside of coding, I'm passionate about video games, music, superhero movies, Star Wars, and traveling.

ðŸŒ± Right now, I'm focusing on learning both frontend and backend development. I'm diving into technologies like Node.js, Docker, PHP, and JavaScript to build full-stack applications.

ðŸ“š I'm always open to learning new things and sharing knowledge with others.

ðŸ’¬ If you have an interesting project or idea, feel free to reach out!
